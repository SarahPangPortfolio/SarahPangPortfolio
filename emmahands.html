        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Tough Titties Designs was created and founded by Emma Hands as a brand specializing in creating light-hearted designed items that promote female empowerment and raise awareness for breast cancer. Heavily emphasizing the inclusion of diverse voices and celebration of individual strengths.<br>
        <br>
        Hands' struggles with social media, leading to a lack of social media presence, making it difficult to keep up with trends and relate to her target market. She wants to truly understand her target audience to pinpoint how to capture her target market and increase her conversion to sales.</p>

        <h2>Empathy</h2>
        <p>After interviewing Hands, several pain points were identified which led to insightful design directions, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the Distinction Between Brand and Identity</li>
            <li>Bridging the Physical and Digital Touchpoints</li>
            <li class="selected">Building Community Connections to the Audience</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>To conduct further research, we analyzed the Etsy and Instagram platforms, and had conversations with people who were interested in Hands' causes, as well as people who were interested in her products. The findings are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Around 50% of Hands' customers write purchase notes to her during online shopping. Customers like to share their experiences and moivations on Etsy reviews</li>
            <li>There is a lack of community on Instagram</li>
            <li>Seeing the different breast shapes on products is extremely important in representation, as it helps with addressing what is not commonly shown, indicating that the supporters are not alone.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information shows that people do have stories to tell and want to share their experiences. However, there exists a disconnect and lack of interaction between the supporters in the current space of Tough Titties Designs.</p>
        <h2>How Might We</h2>
        <p>help customers who support women empowerment better connect with the business by building a sense of community in a space that has a desire of belonging and interactions?</p>

        <h2>Proposal</h2>
        <p>The proposed design includes an interactive space where customers can connect with one another and share personal stories and experiences. The solution uses breast icons to represent individuals, and displays written stories when the icons are selected.</p>
        <p>Art Direction</p>
        <p>The design aims to maintain a fun and light-hearted approach, inspired by Hands' brand identity, despite the serious problem space. Adopting Tough Titties Designs' simple visual design and branding colors, and added customizable boob shapes to enhance their existing variety.</p>
