        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Jazzdoor is a festival where contemporary jazz performers and producers showcase their compositions and improvised music.<br>
        <br>The microsite is set after the festival has happened, and serves the purpose of showcasing highlights from the performances. Users of any familiarity level can use the site to relive experiences or discover new artists.</p>

        <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <div class="content-strat-container">
            <div class="content-strat-item">
                <img class="front_img" src="img/Jazzdoor/Jazzdoor_Festival_Lineup.png" alt="Jazzdoor microsite lineup page. A row of albums with a vinyl disc poping up when the user hovers over it.">
                <p>Festival Lineup:</p>
                <p>Vinyl album covers are used to present the artists in a unique and meaningful way, with each cover corresponding to the album that the artist performed at the festival.</p>

                <p>Performance Archive:</p>

        <h2>Art Direction</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Fonts:</p>
            <p>The dynamic energy from Herokid Bold adds to the jazz genre by emphasizing the artist and album names. The line spacing has been adjusted to align with the narrow rectangular shapes in the background, creating a visually harmonious composition.</p>

            <p>DM Mono pays homage to the fonts commonly used on vinyl records, giving a nostalgic record shop theme. Its multiple weights establishes a clear hierarchy of information to ensure that important details are prominent, readable, and contributes to the overall atmosphere of the microsite.</p>

            <p>Color System:</p>
            <p>The dominant primary colors from the original poster are translated to the microsite as interactable elements. The bold colors contrasts against the soft textured background to create visual balance.</p>

            <p>Monochrome Filter</p>
            <p>Videos in the media player are in black and white to instead shift the user's focus to the music playing. This also establishes balance against the loud primary colors of the microsite.</p>

            <p>Nostalgic Realism</p>
            <p>Textures are used to add to the nostalgic theme by translating the physical feel of vintage items into the digital space as seen on the background and vinyl covers resembling paper and plastic respectively.</p>
