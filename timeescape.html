            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Time Escape is an escape room business focused on creating rich immersive experiences through inclusive and unique puzzles, theme specific decors, and positive customer service.<br>
            <br>
            The task is to design a technological solution to some area of process which could be improved within the client's operational routine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Initial Framing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain a good understanding of Time Escape and their goals</li>
            <li>Take note of existing pain points throught the businesses' operation process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is done through visiting the location to form a stronger relationship with the owners and employees. Interviews were conducted with the shareholders to gather insight on the operation process<br>
        <br>
        Areas of pain points found include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disposal of room materials when changing themes</li>
            <li class="selected">Physical waiver forms that need to be held onto for 2 years in case of legal actions being pursude</li>
            <li>All customer membership details are held on a spread sheet which is manually entered by hand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Selecting the second issue, further on-site observations and interviews were conducted with the owner and employees regarding the waiver form usage. It is noted that new waiver forms need to be printed oftenly and stored within the owner's office. At the end of every day, the employees clear out the drawer that is full of forms collected throughout the day. The forms are also used to hold information regarding what game the pary played, what time, and what format in which the payment was made.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>How might we create a digital solution that increases the efficiency and organization of the waiver collection system?</p>

        <h2>Research Analysis</h2>
        <p>Personas</p>
        <p>Three personas were made for potential users who would interact within the framed design focus and problem: the usage/storage of physical waiver forms. They followed the point of view of the owner, an employee, and a customer; determining their goals and frustrations in their relevant interactions with the waiver forms.</p>

        <p>User Journey Maps</p>
        <p>Understanding the personas provided a foudation to create user journey maps, following the interactions of the owner and employees. The purpose is to map out parts of the signing waiver form process that could cause further pain points and frustrations.</p>
