        <h1>Waiver System</h1>
        <div class="one-column-container">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Tablet_UI.png" alt="Time Escape tablet screen.">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Time Escape is an escape room business focused on creating rich immersive experiences through inclusive and unique puzzles, theme specific decors, and positive customer service.<br>
            <br>
            The task is to design a technological solution to some area of process which could be improved within the client's operational routine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Initial Framing</h2>
        <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Time_Escape_Business.jpg" alt="Image of the Time Escape logo at their Richmond location.">
        <ul>
            <li>Gain a good understanding of Time Escape and their goals</li>
            <li>Take note of existing pain points throught the businesses' operation process</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is done through visiting the location to form a stronger relationship with the owners and employees. Interviews were conducted with the shareholders to gather insight on the operation process<br>
        <br>
        Areas of pain points found include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disposal of room materials when changing themes</li>
            <li class="selected">Physical waiver forms that need to be held onto for 2 years in case of legal actions being pursude</li>
            <li>All customer membership details are held on a spread sheet which is manually entered by hand.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="three-columns-container" id="business-context">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Front_Desk_Papers.jpg" alt="Image of the front desk drawer full of waiver forms.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Filed Papers.jpg" alt="Picture of the filed waiver forms at the Richmond location.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Paper_Form.jpg" alt="A picture of the paper waiver form used by the business.">
        </div>
        <p>Selecting the second issue, further on-site observations and interviews were conducted with the owner and employees regarding the waiver form usage. It is noted that new waiver forms need to be printed oftenly and stored within the owner's office. At the end of every day, the employees clear out the drawer that is full of forms collected throughout the day. The forms are also used to hold information regarding what game the pary played, what time, and what format in which the payment was made.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
        <p>How might we create a digital solution that increases the efficiency and organization of the waiver collection system?</p>

        <h2>Research Analysis</h2>
        <p>Personas</p>
        <p>Three personas were made for potential users who would interact within the framed design focus and problem: the usage/storage of physical waiver forms. They followed the point of view of the owner, an employee, and a customer; determining their goals and frustrations in their relevant interactions with the waiver forms.</p>
        <div class="three-columns-container">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Persona_Owner.png" alt="Persona of the Time Escape owner regarding their goals and frustrations.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Persona_Employee.png" alt="Persona of the Time Escape employee regarding their goals and frustrations.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Persona_Customer.png" alt="Persona of the Time Escape customer regarding their goals and frustrations.">
        </div>

        <p>User Journey Maps</p>
        <p>Understanding the personas provided a foudation to create user journey maps, following the interactions of the owner and employees. The purpose is to map out parts of the signing waiver form process that could cause further pain points and frustrations.</p>
        <div class="two-columns-container">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Journey_Map_Owner.png" alt="Journey map of the Time Escape owner regarding the waiver form interaction.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Journey_Map_Employee.png" alt="Journey map of the Time Escape employee regarding the waiver form interaction.">
        </div>

        <p>Journey Map Take Aways</p>
        <div class="two-columns-container" id="take-aways">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Owner.png" alt="Illustration of the owner.">
            <p>Owner:<br>Morgan often struggle to find specific documents as the organization system of files is lacking since waiver forms are to be held on to for 2 years.</p>
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Employee.png" alt="Illustration of the employee.">
            <p>Employee:<br>Anthony struggles to keep waiver and forms organized at the customer service desk without a clear, structured system to follow.</p>
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Customer.png" alt="Illustration of the customer.">
            <p>Customer:<br>Nicole is frustrated when other members of her party take too long to fill out their waiver forms. She wants to  start solving puzzles as soon as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <div class="three-columns-container" id="design-concepts">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/QR_code.png" alt="Illustration of a phone with a QR code.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/At_Home_Sign.png" alt="Illustration of a waiver form and person using a laptop.">
            <img src="/img/TimeEscape/Digital_Waiver.png" alt="Illustration of a person signing a board in an office.">
            <p>In-store QR code</p>
            <p class="selected">Digitalizing information while mainting physical intercation</p>
            <p>At-home agreement system</p>
        </div>

        <p>The proposed solution includes the implementation of a digital waiver system that would allow customers to sign forms through an in-store tablet, allowing the storage of forms within a database. Employees can access this data from a secondary display where key information regarding the game and players, including the date played, game type, and payment type is stored and tracked.</p>
